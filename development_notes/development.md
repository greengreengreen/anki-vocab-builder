Project description: 

Majority of the things i want to recall are from books and blogs. So they have a context. 
Kindle highlights are one of the major sources to build my deck. 
Other than that, I read blogs. So they are some sources too. 
Given this, we design the deck to follow a question answer formats. 

Type1: Type-in quiz. 
This is the most basic format. 

Example:

Front:
```
I guess I should explain how Mars missions work, for any _____ who may be reading this.

Source: The Martian (Weir, Andy)
```

Back:
```
Answer: layman

Meaning: A person without professional knowledge in a particular subject

Examples:
He explained the complex procedure in layman's terms.
```


Type2: QA quiz.

Front 
```
How do you decide what to master?

Source: How to Live: 27 conflicting answers and one weird conclusion (Sivers, Derek)
```

Back
```
Answer: Pick anything that scares you, fascinates you, or infuriates you.

Quotes from the book: How to Live: 27 conflicting answers and one weird conclusion (Sivers, Derek)

If you haven’t decided what to master, pick anything that scares you, fascinates you, or infuriates you. 
Don’t ask, “Is this the real me?” or “Is this my passion?” 
Those questions lead to endless searching and disappointment.
```


There are other questions that we need to address too. but not urgent. 
1. How to get the highlights from kindle? </br>
For MVP version, we just copy the file My Clippings.txt to the input folder.
2. How do we generate the quiz questions? </br>
For MVP version, we just use the openai API.
3. How do we generate the audio? </br>
In MVP version, we don't include audio. This is for the future.
